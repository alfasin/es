    "text": "The whole article is flawed in one major point. They assume that women are buying women\u0026#x27;s magazines because they are for women. In reality they are buying magazines that are of interest for them. Thus women\u0026#x27;s magazines are women\u0026#x27;s magazines because of the content. If you change the content (let it be rocket engine construction) it won\u0026#x27;t be women\u0026#x27;s magazine anymore because women won\u0026#x27;t buy it.\u003cp\u003eI think this is a typical mistake feminists make. Instead of understanding and accepting what women want, they represents their view of what they should want and blame all other factors (stereotype anyone?).",
